Enhancing a Community Library Website
Welcome to the Community Library Website Enhancement project! This capstone project focuses on improving the library’s website while also learning and practicing essential Git and GitHub workflows. It’s a team effort by Morgan and Jamie, with a focus on collaboration, version control, and conflict resolution.

Project Objectives
Cloning and Branching

Practice cloning a repository and creating branches for feature development.
Collaboration with Git

Gain hands-on experience in staging, committing, and pushing changes while working together.
Pull Requests and Conflict Resolution

Learn how to create and review Pull Requests (PRs), resolve conflicts, and merge changes into the main branch.

Getting Started
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

            git clone https://github.com/skimeh/greenwood-library-website.git
            cd greenwood-library-website
Making Changes
Create a branch for Morgan and Jamie:
            git checkout -b add-book-reviews
            git checkout -b update-events
After making changes, stage and commit them:
            git add add-book-reviews
            git commit -m "Morgan's branch"

            git add update-events
            git commit -m "Jamie's branch"
Push your branch to the remote repository:
            git push origin add-book-reviews
            git push origin update-events
Collaboration
Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub for your branch.
Review each other’s changes, resolve any conflicts, and then merge the PR into the main branch.
